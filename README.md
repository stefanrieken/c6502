This is a rewrite of my Simple64 project in C.

That project replicates the functionality of 6502asm.com .

Status
------

The app launches a display and loads code into memory.
It is not yet executed.

To make things more spectacular for now, the code is loaded into
display memory (see file.c to change this back).
